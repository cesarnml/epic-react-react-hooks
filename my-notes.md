# Epic React - Reach Hooks Workshop

## Lessons

### Lesson 01 - useState: greeting

- Didn't learn anything new

### Lesson 02 - useEffect: persisting state

- *React's useState hook allows you to pass a function instead of the actual value, and then it will only call that function to get the state value when the component is rendered the first time*
- Hook Order Flow:
  - Mount: Component starts render, state initializes, component finishes rendering, effects are run
  - Update: Component starts rerender, state updates, finishes render, cleanup effects are run, effects are run again
  - Dismount: cleanup effects are run
  - App renders top-to-bottom. Clean ups run bottom-to-top
